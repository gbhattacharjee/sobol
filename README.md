This repository includes all files (both scripts and results) necessary to reproduce the figures in the paper 'Using global variance-based sensitivity analysis to prioritise bridge retrofits in a regional road network subject to seismic hazard' by G. Bhattacharjee and J. W. Baker. Many of these figures have already been reproduced and stored in the directory figs. The scripts can be modified to estimate the Sobol' indices of bridges in other regional road networks, too.
