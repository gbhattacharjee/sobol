This repository includes all files (both scripts and results) necessary to reproduce the figures in the paper 'Using global variance-based sensitivity analysis to prioritise bridge retrofits in a regional road network subject to seismic hazard' by G. Bhattacharjee and J. W. Baker. Many of these figures have already been reproduced and stored in the directory figs. The scripts can be modified to estimate the Sobol' indices of bridges in other regional road networks, too. 

CONTENTS details the contents of each directory as well as the purpose of each script.
CONFIG specifies which version of Python you should use to run the scripts included in this repository, as well as the packages you need to install.
BENCHMARKS includes detailed outputs against which to verify the results you get when running certain scripts on your own machine.
